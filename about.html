            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hi, we are Kosmic Dance Club!
                This organization was started at the University of South Carolina to provide an environment for people who enjoy K-Pop dance to come together to dance and socialize. The two founders of this club created this club to give a safe space for students to have fun and dance.
                
                We encourage any student at USC with an interest in K-Pop dance to join no matter the skill level or experience. Whether you want to casually learn a K-Pop dance for fun or join us in competition and performance pieces, this is the place for you! </p>
